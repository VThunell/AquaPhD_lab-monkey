# AquaPhD_lab-monkey

## Github to Rstudio and Rmarkdown

Repo for an exercise in Github using Rstudio and also Rmarkdown.

1. Install Git etc using instructions in Thunell_GitRStudioStart.txt

2. Make changes to your Repo and commit, then push them. 

Now you're ready for our collaboration in which we produce a introductory R-exercise for MSc students with code (.R) and intructions provided in a Rmarkdown document (.Rmd) 

3. Clone this repo (lab-monkey) by clicking green button "code" and create a version control project in Rstudio.

4. Make changes to .Rmd and/or the .R file

5. Commit and push. This will become a pull request for the master branch (I think). From here I can guide no longer...

3. Fork this repo (lab-monkey), and make chnages to .Rmd and/or the .R file
