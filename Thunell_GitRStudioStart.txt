- "The shell is a program on your computer whose job is to run other programs. Pseudo-synonyms are “terminal”, “command line”, and “console”. The most common shell for Git is bash"


### Steps taken
1- Make github profile and a reporsitory, url :
https://github.com/VThunell/Warming_IGP_communities

2- Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win:
Use suggested settings apart from preferred browser if optional, dont use internet explorer!

3- Configure ssh keys:
Google: what are ssh keys
To configure the ssh key in github and Rstudio, I looked at:

https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html

https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

4- Restart Rstudio (I updated R and Rstudio)
File > new project > version control option > Git/SVN

5- This helped to fix path issue for Git:

4- Restart Rstudio
File > new project > version control option > Git/SVN
when:
create project > git/svn >
Add repository url etc.

6- My Git tab not showing up:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34891827/rstudio-gives-incorrect-function-when-setting-git-as-version-control/35576068

7- Issue of server based path and administrative rights:
Change permission (readble/writable) for Git in C:\Program (right click > säkerhet)
Make a directory at C:\Users\vitl0001 where my repositories are saved localy instead of at a server path. Make sure that there is no space in the path

Maybe: You need to run Rstudio as an admin to set this up for the project:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34891827/rstudio-gives-incorrect-function-when-setting-git-as-version-control/35576068
"What version of Windows are you using? You should be able to right-click on the Rstudio.exe icon, click Properties, and select an option to always run Rstudio as administrator. Be sure you use that same icon whenever you want to open Rstudio"

8- Resinstall Git (not sure if needed). 

9- In Git bash, set where my repo is and initiate by:
cd C:/Users/vitl0001/VThunell_repos/Warming_IGP_communities
git init

VOILA!!! (hopefully)
