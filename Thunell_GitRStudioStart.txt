How to Start using Github with Rstudio 20210203:

DISCLAIMER: This installation is connected to issues with the interactions of SLU computers, R and Rstudio-Github and I take no responsibility of possible side effects of following these instructions :)

"The shell is a program on your computer whose job is to run other programs. Pseudo-synonyms are “terminal”, “command line”, and “console”. The most common shell for Git is bash"

### Steps taken to Install/Connect github with Rstudio
1- Make github profile and start a repository (e.g. Name_Repo) to test intallation on:
https://github.com/

write something in the README.md file and save it

2- Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win:
Use suggested settings apart from preferred browser if optional, dont use internet explorer!

BONUS step: Updating R and Rstudio might be a (very) good thing!

3- Configure ssh keys:
Google: what are ssh keys
To configure the ssh key in github and Rstudio, I looked at:

https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html

https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

4- Restart Rstudio 
then go to: File > new project > version control option > Git/SVN

From here, there are likely several issues. Going about them sucessfully is a matter of googling, trial-and-error and might be computer etc. dependent. ALSO: be solution-oriented and bold!

5- For me, this helped to fix path issue for Git:

6 - Restart Rstudio
File > new project > version control option > Git/SVN
when:
create project > git/svn >
Add repository url etc.

6- My Git tab is not showing up! This helped me:

7- Issue of server based path and administrative rights:
Change permission (readble/writable) for Git in C:\Program (right click > säkerhet/security)
Make a directory at C:\Users\username where my repositories are saved localy instead of at a server path. Make sure that there is no space in the path

Maybe 1. (try without it first): You need to run Rstudio as an admin to set this up for the project:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34891827/rstudio-gives-incorrect-function-when-setting-git-as-version-control/35576068
"What version of Windows are you using? You should be able to right-click on the Rstudio.exe icon, click Properties, and select an option to always run Rstudio as administrator. Be sure you use that same icon whenever you want to open Rstudio"

Maybe 2. - Resinstall Git (not sure if needed). 

Maybe 3. - In Git bash, set where my repo is and initiate by:
cd C:/Users/vitl0001/VThunell_repos/Warming_IGP_communities
git init

VOILA!!! (hopefully)
Pull your repo from Git (blue arrow)
